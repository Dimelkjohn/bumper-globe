                        Absolutely. We generally order your vehicle's parts at the time we write the estimate. We typically schedule your vehicle for drop-off 
                        a days after the initial estimate, unless itâ€™s found unsafe to drive.  If that is the case, we will help you arrange for a rental vehicle

                        No. A car is a total loss only when the price of repairs exceeds the insurance company's determined value of your vehicle. 
                        Nowadays, most cars are built using unibody (frame and body as one) construction.  Our highly skilled technicians, 
                        with the aid of our state-of-the-art Car-O-Liner Cartronics and Chief Velocity computer measuring systems, can return 
                        your vehicle to its original factory specifications.  If it is determined that the frame section is bent beyond repair, 
                        that section can simply be replaced.

                            <li>Wash the vehicle by hand with cool water and a very mild car wash solution using a soft cloth or sponge.</li>
                            <li>Always use clean fresh water.</li>
                            <li>Wash your vehicle in the shade.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>DON'T -</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not use a commercial car wash.</li>
                            <li>Stiff brushes or sponges could mar the finish and damage the surface.</li>
                            <li>Do not "dry wipe" your vehicle, dry wiping can scratch the finish.</li>
                            <li>Do not drive on gravel roads.</li>
                            <li>Chipping the finish can easily occur in the first 30 days.</li>
                            <li>
                                Avoid parking under trees and utility lines which are likely to attract birds, 
                                bird droppings have a high acid content and will damage a freshly painted surface. 
                                Also, tree sap can mar or spot a freshly painted surface.
                            </li>
                            <li>Do not spill gasoline, oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, or windshield solvent on the new finish.</li>
                            <li>Do not scrape ice or snow from the newly painted surface.</li>
                        </ul>
